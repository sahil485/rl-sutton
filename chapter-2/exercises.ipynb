    "Consider a $k$-armed bandit problem with $k = 4$ actions, denoted 1, 2, 3, and 4. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using $\\varepsilon$-greedy action selection, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of $Q_1(a) = 0$, for all $a$. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is $A_1 = 1$, $R_1 = -1$, $A_2 = 2$, $R_2 = 1$, $A_3 = 2$, $R_3 = -2$, $A_4 = 2$, $R_4 = 2$, $A_5 = 3$, $R_5 = 0$. On some of these time steps the $\\varepsilon$ case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?\n",

    "Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the difficulties that sample-average methods have for nonstationary problems. Use a modified version of the 10-armed testbed in which all the $q_*(a)$ start out equal and then take independent random walks (say by adding a normally distributed increment with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01 to all the $q_*(a)$ on each step). Prepare plots like Figure 2.2 for an action-value method using sample averages, incrementally computed, and another action-value method using a constant step-size parameter, $\\alpha = 0.1$. Use $\\varepsilon = 0.1$ and longer runs, say of 10,000 steps.\n",
